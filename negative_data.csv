17813,B00007GDDD,2.0,A3GXOHHC0AHSFS,The strap is not affixed at the correct spot so it will flip over and everything will fall out. I modified it so the strap attaches at a balanced location. It is true that your cards can fall out the side. I addressed this by putting more than one card in a slot and leaving the slot closest to the edge empty. I use it but probably won't for very long.,Move on to other purses,Negative

It seems like something has changed in the sizing.  I've been a 48 in birkenstock of all types since I first purchased birkenstock.  I did once have to buy a smaller size (46) because I was in a bind and I ended up buying another (correct, 48) pair a couple weeks later.  This feels like that smaller sized shoe, like a 46.

It's made of your typical Halloween mask material. Rubbery and it smells. Of course they shipped it in a bag so it's smoothed and deformed. The paint job is terrible. And there looks to be some sort of mold

The seams in the front, and in the back, and over the nipple (seams over the nipple in a nursing bra, are you kidding?!) all hurt.  And itch.  Look at that picture and all those seams and imagine them all scratching and irritating you, and the back hurting and itching as well, and save your money.  The nipple seams hurt even with nursing pads.

I bought a large because it was the only size available, I'm more of a small size but it fits ok since it's a cape anyway.  As others have said, the head piece is completely useless, it's some very cheap foam material that doesn't hold its shape at all.

19238,B00007GDG5,1.0,AF0ZTX6XVNZ5W,"at least not any leather I've ever seen.  Even the wallet itself has two inserts titled ""Materials"" that explain that the exterior is (supposedly) leather and the interior is manmade materials.  Yet the website simply says ""Genuine Leather"" - as if for the whole wallet.  And there is a stamp embossed into the backside of the wallet also saying ""Genuine Leather"" - even though, by their own admission on the inserts, it only refers to the ""exterior.""  Yet even the exterior is not remotely like any real, new leather I have ever seen or sniffed.  This must be ""PU leather"" or some such.  It doesn't smell like leather (smells chemically actually) and it doesn't look like leather.  It looks like a ""processed meat"" version of leather from a wallet sausage factory.

In addition, some of the commenters referred to it having a pen holder, which to me was an attribute.  Be advised that the pen holder is merely a slit in the interior ""manmade material"" to hook a pen over.  It's not the usual kind of pen holder in a wallet, which is a loop of leather to insert a pen through.

Also, to confirm what others have reported, the checkbook divider is not removable despite what it says here - that's another misrepresentation about this item.

Somehow this wallet is getting mostly rave reviews, which now completely baffle me.  Maybe the fake-leather look is more obvious in the Mahogany color but that's the only color that suited me of the choices given.","This is NOT ""Genuine leather"" ...",Negative

23648,B0000868IP,2.0,A2KYOZKBS0M7F9,"Since Bali discontinued the bra that was my favorite (one that had truly non-slip straps), I thought I'd once again try this old standby which has been available for decades. It's a good product, but it is far from perfect.

Good points: the bra is supportive if you can get the straps to stay up, it is not ugly, and it runs mostly true to size.

Bad points: the underwires have no cushioning and feel harsh against the skin, and the straps slip off my shoulders constantly, which is the reason I stopped wearing this style before.

The ad copy claims that the straps and back have been redesigned into a ""Comfort-U"" shape to eliminate slipping, so I thought I'd give this bra a try again. Unfortunately, it really doesn't work. In two days of wearing my brand-new purchases, I find that the straps constantly fall onto my arms and that I must replace them back onto my shoulders every few minutes. This affects the ability of the bra to provide support, and is a major annoyance, especially when I'm active, or when I'm in a business meeting where I really, really do not want to be fiddling with my clothing.

I won't be buying more of this style.",Slippy straps - ugh!,Negative
17792,B00007GDDD,1.0,A2TSO9X2HP54R0,Bad design as the 2 flaps in front (where you put credit cards) weight the bag to tip and everything falls out.  I used the bag once and one of the flaps has already started to tear away from the purse.  JUNK.,Don't.,Negative

After less than a month I was starting to see the edges starting to run. I was happy to find a nursing bra in 42L (don't have any options at this size), but I can't wait to be finished nursing so I can go back to a sturdy, supportive bra.

The straps look somewhat wide, but under load they end up bunching up and digging in more than others. Keep trying Fancee Free, maybe some day you'll figure out that the same designs and fabrics just don't scale up the same when you get into bigger cup sizes. I look forward to the day when a large size bra is actually designed and built for the large size bust. Someone let me know when they do, this  one just doesn't cut it.",better than nothing,Negative

I even tried trimming the lace off but it's not the lace.  It is the fabric around the inside edge.  I am not sure what type of fabric it is but it definitely is not cotton!  When I took this bra off after wearing for a few hours my skin was red and very irritated around the edges of the bra.  The cup fit ok and inside seams didn't bother me.

What is ridiculous about the size is I read many reviews before deciding to order this brand.  I read a lot of good reviews how people liked this brand.  One person noted the waist was too short, so I purposely ordered the size larger than my range.  The size I ordered goes up a full 40 pounds more than what I weigh and I'm only 5'4"" - my legs are normal for my size - the crotch did not even come all the way up!  I was stuck and had to wear them.  They were extremely uncomfortable!  The waist was way too low!  After a couple of hours and keeping adjusting in the bathroom I was finally able to get the crotch all the way up, but the waist was still way too low!

I will be going back to wearing Legs and Spanx though they are more expensive at least they fit right.

The toebox is far too small, way to narrow and cramped for your toes to spread out. There were some Loose Fit Oxes once upon a time, but Converse refuses to make them anymore. They want to crush our feet into some narrow ideal foot shape for reasons beyond my comprehension. I have also read that the soles separate very easily from the main shoe now with the new models So these are utter crap now.

TIP: Avoid Vans because while they allow your foot more room, your heel will slide in and out of the shoe. You can use Feiyues, but there are no solid black styles.

2923,B00001W0J3,2.0,A2E9TYIROO31SM,"I purchased this outfit for my one year daughter for Halloween. I wasn't expecting too much for the price I paid, so overall I would say that I got what I expected. The size stated on the outfit was 12-18 months. My daughter is on the small side and this was not big on her at all. At the time she wore it she was 13 months and wearing 9 month clothing.  The quality of the material is pretty low and tore easily during the only time she wore it. In addition, there is a medallion in the center of the dress by the neckline. The medallion is not secured very well and was constantly flopping around and getting in the way. Lastly, the ears that come with the costume are very flimsy and one ear constantly flops over. Overall, if you are looking for an inexpensive Minnie Mouse costume and don't play on using it too much, this may do the job. However, if you are looking for a costume that your child can wear multiple times, this may not work.

Cons:
1) The costume is much smaller than the stated 12 to 18 month size. It fit my daughter who was wearing 9 month size clothes at the time.
2) The material is not great and the material around the shoulder/sleeve tore slightly during first wear.
3) The medallion in the center is not secured well and gets in the way.
4) The ears are not well made and one ear was folded over.
5) The buttons on the back of the dress don't secure it very well.

Since I loved the design of the purse so much I thought maybe I could ""fix"" it by just removing the snaps and putting a magnet in it's place but I guess the magnet wasn't strong enough and the flap kept popping open.  In addition, the straps connect at the back of the purse, tipping the purse forward toward the flaps, making it ""front heavy"" so when you would pick up the purse without the front flap being fastened, everything would dump out of the purse.

2294,B00001T38R,2.0,A3US14M120N9JE,"I ordered this helmet thinking it would be better than the 2 piece mask that came with the Deluxe Boba Fett costume.  I read the reviews, which were mostly positive....in my opinion the mask is below expectation.  Do not buy this if you are expecting anything better.

The visor is half vinyl, half plastic visor.  Not sure why. You can see this in the stock photo, and I should have noticed it before purchasing because its not what I would expect.

The overall shape of the helmet is just not quite right. It seems to be constructed too narrow overall.  The bottom of the ""visor"" is tapered outward from the top, and is then too wide at the bottom. The profile of the mask also extends outwards.  The paint job is not that great.  The red is very dull.  Its also lacks the contrast of the greens on the mask.

The only pro's is that its a helmet, not a mask, and it has the dent in the top..and an antenna that leans to one side..Thats all the positives I can find.

I do not try to find the negatives, but I find the mask is below expectations.  I do not recommend spending $40 for this when the mask that comes with the costume has better paint, and overall looks better.",Not That Great,Negative

If you can actually find it, I would highly recommend buying the ""Bali Smooth Compliments Underwire Bra #3100"" instead (Amazon has a few left). IT actually fits like a glove, has great support, the straps don't slip or dig in and, it looks pretty and feels amazing.

One person noted the waist was too short, so I purposely ordered the size larger than my range.

The foam hat won't stay on my daughters head and was bent during shipping. The thin, cheap costume was ripped 3 1/2 inches in the crotch area with sideways runs that I am unable to sew. Not to mention it is so cheaply made it hardly looks like Jessie. We ordered a 4T, my daughter usually wears a 4T-5T, this costume was huge on her. The crotch area hangs down almost to her knees. This is odd bc shes very tall for her age and another parent's review says it was way too small for their child. The hat, however, is so small in comparison to the clothing part. I tried to return it through Amazon and due to it being through another seller they can not exchange it, just a cash refund. Unfortuantly, I cut the credit card so I am now stuck with this horrible costume! They will not let me exchange it for another of equal value or even for the same one. The worst part is when my daughter opened the package she was beside herself with excitement untill we found the rip and the bent hat that won't stay on her head. Needless to say, my little girl cried bc she has ""a ruined costume"" and ""she doesnt look like Jessie"". Thank you to Amazon and the 3rd party seller for crushing my 3-year-old. DO NOT BUY THIS COSTUME!!! Amazon should check the products that they ship for quality and damage. The costume we orded last year was melted into a pile and when we pulled it apart it shredded. When we tried to exchange it they were sold out and my daughter wasn't able to be what she wanted to be. This is the second year in a row that they have sent damaged products.

He's used it twice to accent his buzz lightyear costume.  The pack is an appropriate size for him.  There are very thin elastic straps with short Velcro strips to wear it like a back pack.  the problem is to actually wear it the jetpack can't be inflated complete.  The Velcro straps are too small to hold.  I am sure the design was meant to be small to hide the straps however this makes them difficult to stay shut & impossible for my son to put it on himself.  He's an independent kiddo so this causes him some frustration.  He's disappointed I can't inflate it completely for him to wear it.  He calls it broken because the wings sag. There's no separate blow in for the top of the wings or the ends of the wings making it difficult to evenly inflate.  Overall... it's a cute accessory but not worth the buy.  I'll probably try safety pinning to his costume for Halloween but wish I hadn't purchased it for him.  He wouldn't miss it if I had passed it up.,Save your $,Negative

When I got to work on Halloween, I went into the bathroom to put it on, and I couldn't believe how painful the seams were against my skin! Mind, I have very sensitive skin, so while other reviews say it was ""itchy,"" I say it felt like torture. I was wearing yoga pants and a cami under the dress, so it was my shoulders and arms that took the brunt of the scratching. I managed to wear the costume for about 10 minutes before having to take it off due to the pain. When I did, I looked like I got into a fight with a feral cat. On my lunch break, I was able to run home and grab a long sleeve shirt to wear underneath. Once I put on the long-sleeve, I was able to wear the costume without problem.

I could barely walk, and every movement hurt. After a day of applying baby powder liberally, I came to realize that the pain in my thighs was actually a second degree burn, complete with blisters and a very painful heat rash that I still have a week later.

18584,B00007GDG5,1.0,A2NW131BJQQ3LS,"I researched leather checkbook wallets for about two weeks. I am a matchy-matchy type person and very picky; purchasing a separate leather checkbook holder that did not match the wallet grain and color exactly was not an option for me.

Criteria are as follows (from most important to least):

1. Red leather
2. Matching checkbook holder
3. Clear ID holder NOT in zippered compartment... snap flap/fold over OK
4. 10+ credit card compartments that are NOT in a zippered compartment
5. At least 1 main zippered compartment for cash and another zippered compartment (within main zippered compartment) for change
6. Exterior pocket on the wallet... zipper preferred, no zipper OK

This wallet appeared to meet all of these criteria. It arrived within the estimated time frame, boxed, in perfect condition. Lovely red pebbled leather everywhere, all zippers slid nicely, and the snap fit securely in both holes. Everything seemed perfect until I tried to stuff my standard-sized Costco checks into the checkbook holder. The holder is at least 1/4"" too narrow; I had to chop off the sides of my checks to stuff them into the holder. Problem solved, right?

NO. I could not close the darned checkbook holder. When I forced the top flap over my checkbook, I had to use a rubber band to hold it down, and the zillion digit routing/account/check number at the bottom was in complete view. It looks ridiculous, and I am beyond irritated every time I have to write a check for Girl Scout Cookies, school pictures, etc. The only reason I am still using it (rubber band and all) is because the leather matches the wallet, and I need another 100 hours to do research to find a replacement wallet/checkbook holder. Why, WHY do wallet manufacturers make gross, cheap plastic wallets anyway? They should know that anyone old fashioned enough to use a checkbook on a regular basis will want REAL LEATHER. I looked at wallets from $20 to $200, and I couldn't find another that met all of my criteria that was 100% leather.

18848,B00007GDAL,1.0,A1D3GOQZ7YIYMV,"I had this on my wishlist and received it as a Christmas gift (bought from Amazon). I have had Buxton wallets for years and years and this one was to be a replacement for the Cardex style I currently had (as I had not searched long enough to find the single cardex available too). One of the reasons this type wallet had always appealed to me was the double currency compartments. I have always kept my receipts in one area and my currency in the other. This wallet is advertised as having two compartments for bills but I was sorely disappointed that the red one I received only had one. The double compartment was the primary reason I wanted this wallet. I am also not sure it is leather as past Buxton wallets have always had it stamped on the leather somewhere. This one does not. Certainly the inside is plastic and it 'crackles' every time I open it. I am very unhappy with this wallet and the poor quality it seems Buxton has sunk to.  Had it not been a gift I would definitely return it.

Update: I finally got around to moving what I had in my old wallet to this new one. TERRIBLE! I only have a few cards and pictures I carry and even though it was not full, I could barely snap the wallet closed. When I put the coins in the coin holder the coin compartment would not stay closed. I took all but one coin out and it STILL would pop open when I snapped it.

  Then, Lugz decided that true leather was just too costly for them. So they went to synthetic material, such as ""nubuck."" The nubuck boots look nothing like the leather Drifter, and they don't last as long, either.
  The Monster II boot resembled the Drifter, but it was apparent after 2 days that there is a steep price to pay for lower cost. The Monster was torn in less than 48 hours, it couldn't be fixed because the material is so cheap, and of course since they'd been worn a couple times, they weren't covered under warranty.
  I'm sure I'm not the only ex-customer who has a problem with Lugz and their new 'lower costs at any price' initiative. The switch from leather to synthetic is probably a substantual cost-cutting tool for the company. The savings that are passed along to the customer? Miniscule.
  Now, the leather Drifter is all but extinct. So i'd like to thank you, Lugz, for manufacturing a quality boot for a little while. As a former customer, I will always say that Lugz started out making a quality product. As far as I'm concerned, the corporate decision-makers at Lugz decided that the customers would be satisfied with any cheap and crummy shoe that they market.

I'm going to have to assume these are not reflective of the brand overall because uh, these were among the more uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life. They seemed to fit as expected. Roomy in the toe, not at all difficult to get on, expectedly snug around the ankle. But I found it was more comfortable to stand on my hard wood floor in SOCKS than it was to stand around in these shoes.

I'm not entirely sure whose idea it was to put a hard layer of stitching right on the back of the ankle, but THIS IS THE WORST THING. My first time wearing them I walked to dinner and back in them - no more than an hour round trip - and on the way back I could barely walk right because the shoes had already torn the skin off the backs of my ankles. Through my socks. I have of course had to wear in shoes before, but you can't wear in something you're afraid to put on again.

It does not seal securely and I found that things (anything carried in the main pocket), would fall out without warning during normal use. Not fun to lose a cell phone or sunglasses! It's probably okay if you really only carry a few things back and forth, or have a set of screwdrivers and wrenches to carry around to jobsites, but most of the little pockets are so constrained that it was not useful for general use by me.

It is rugged and it weared well for a couple of months, but I had to switch to something bigger and more secure in holding onto its contents. If the main flap went all the way to the bottom it would probably be much more secure -- the top flap barely overlaps the main pocket. Also, the central clasp makes the bag tend to fold in half around it.

2) outside ""all star"" label on the tongue is rubber, not clothe
3) inside label is only stitched on one side and on in the center of the tongue
4) soles feel a bit plastics
5) no texture on top strip of soles around shoe. Inside the shoe (on the sole) is black with converse in white lettering
6) actual material feels cheap.

will add photos later.

maybe seller messed up contacting them now.

6036,B0000643Q8,1.0,A2K11NKKO5C1QD,"I have three Skagen watches. They are beautiful. However here are the issues I have with them:

Most importantly, everything about this watch is propriatery. Changing batteries is a pain as you can't find them locally and it costs $14.95. Bands are $34.95. Also you better keep your sales receipt even though they have lifetime warranty.

I sent in my replacement band and battery with payment for two watches in July and they cashed the check and didn't receive anything until January.  I called them and they promised to send a free battery, but when I received the items finally in March, no battery was included (let alone a free one).

Other issues:

a) Wire mesh bands: The clasp is not always tight and over time will slide and get a little loose. Also the titanium mesh is made of tiny small circles of metal interlocked and if one of them gets open (say you hit something), it starts unraveling slowly but surely.

b) Leather band: The one I have fell apart so quickly it is surprising. It also started smelling bad due to sweat (I do not sweat that much and I owned other watches with leather bands). This seems to be a very bad quality.

c) Water - my watch started fogging after 2 years of light usage.

6047,B0000643Q8,1.0,A4R41IUBTO5OI,"I've had this watch for maybe 6 month now.

I bought it simply because it was made of titanium and looked good, and I get metal allergy from anything else.  I first had a black skagen mesh watch, but it was not 100% titanium, and started to give me a rash when the paint wore off. This one is perfect however. I use it every day. It has gotten one nick in the crystal. It is my first watch ever not to give me a rash.

I also have received questions like, ""Is that watch something special?"". So I guess it must look good.

Update, I have to downgrade this watch. I have owned 3 Skagen watches now, and while they look OK, they are not made for every day use. On one the clamp eventually broke off, and the glass broke very easily on another (and the first one was far from hypoallergenic).  The clamp is  design issue. The band kept opening after even the lightest bump with the hand. Only way to get it to sit was to bend the clamp in slightly to increase the tension. But titanium is too brittle to bend well, so eventually, some months later it just snapped off. keep it on  At the price I'd expect something that last a few years.  Unfortunately there are not a lot of affordable options out there.  Ideally, there should be a watch with a soilicone strap, and a titanium body.","Stylish, but poor quality",Negative

I had been looking for something that would keep me motionless up top as I run and jump rope. I might add that I've never spent what amounts to the annual salary of a worker in an underdeveloped nation for one exercise bra. It's quite ridiculous especially when considering what I'm about to say...

Oh, don't get me wrong. It looks quite formidable--just like the pics, but au contraire. I was excited as I put her on for a test drive this morning. It looked pretty inconspicuous under my clothes-- a good sign I told myself. I walked a couple laps around the track then picked up my jump rope and proceeded to jump & JIGGGLLLLEE-- yes ladies-- jiggle. I'm reeeeaally disappointed because I'm rather shy and needed something that would allow me to jump rope sort of unnoticed while out in public. It looks like it'd probably serve well as a bust minimizer, but it's not my idea of a truly supportive exercise bra.
And, it's certainly not worth the $64 I paid.

Pulling them from the package, the very first thing I noticed is that they feel distinctly like cheese cloth...no, they feel exactly like cheese cloth! Using the term ""silk"" in the title is a bit misleading because, while I might be able to say they are smooth, there is nothing remotely silky about them. The texture is a bit more harsh than I anticipated... well, a lot more I suppose. Of every pair of hose I've ever felt, these are without a doubt the least soft of the bunch. As you might expect, this made putting them on less than pleasant.

I put one foot in first and immediately noticed how tight they were (think ted support socks for edema - if that's what you're looking for, you're in the right place). They are tight enough that when I got them up I realized I should have stretched them further because I had no place to grab onto them to pull more ""slack"" upward to get them higher. While pulling them up my calves I also realized that I should have shaved before putting them on, pulling this texture across my skin may have been uncomfortable, but on unshaven legs it was a tad painful (perhaps I'm a bit sensitive but I cannot stress how rough they felt going on).

Once I had them in place my first thought was disappointment, the color, ""barely there"" was more akin to tan/brown, while this may work for some people, my skin is porcelain white. Although I was anticipating nylons that were visibly nylons, I was expecting it to be only somewhat obvious, not ""I've spent a whole year in the tropics wearing shorts with long sleeved turtle neck"". If you can't get a proper mental picture, just look at the display picture for this particular color, then compare it to the white background. There's nothing remotely natural about the difference. I really just assumed the slight darkness in the photo was just lighting related, but it really is that dark in decent lighting.

On a more positive note. After I got over looking at the too dark coloration, I did find that they moved comfortably, I didn't notice the texture too terribly without actually moving my skin across it in some manner. They stretched and moved well, so, while they are comfortable enough to wear, I would certainly hope no one intended to rub against my leg because they may mistake it for burlap. The absolute one factor that kept me from immediately packing it up to mail it back in the fact that the top did ""control"" and smooth. I was looking for something that would help create a smoother silhouette and while the jury is still out and I still need further evaluation before I make a decision, that definitely helped its case. I still don't know if I'll keep them, because I hated literally everything else about them, they might get the job done, but I never would have bought them if I'd tried them on first!

When the replacement came, I discovered it was missing an inner pocket that also divided the snap pouch into two areas! I carry my tablet and Kindle with me everywhere, and I always stow my gadgets behind this inner pocket. I also bring a variety of gift cards and other small tchotchkes such as headphones or validated parking receipts. The new Kipling Lancelot has no space for these items!

Furthermore, the new Kipling Lancelot does not have the two little pen pockets. They moved the pen pocket to set between to larger pockets. Now my phone no longer fits in the pocket I usually carry it in!

It's unacceptable. The manufacturing standards were obviously dropped to make the newer version of this Kipling purse.

I have back fat. I need to flatten said back fat. While it sort of did that, it created a whole new roll of back fat above the band. The band seemed be lower in the back. However, I compared it to my other bras and the band seems the same width and shape, so I don't know.  I didn't have the luxury of trying before I bought.  Admittedly, the issue might just be that I bought a size too small. Just mentioning it in case any other women with a similar body issue were thinking of purchasing. If you can, definitely try before you buy to make sure.

My main issue, however, is the straps. They just don't get tight enough. I shortened them as much as they would go, and it just wasn't enough.  I was visibly sagged in the front. If I can reach up and tighten straps with my hands and lift my girls, it's not a good thing. I didn't think it was very supportive.

I'd heard that the Skagen brand was very dependable, but I have found this to not be the case.  The watch was only used one time , this year in fact.  I had a new battery installed and it ran for about 2 hours.  I found that if I continued to shake it, it would run but as soon as I stopped it stopped after about 30 minutes.  The jewelry repair rep had me bring it back to see if the connections were meeting and they were.  The screw to wound the watch is so tiny I could barely grasp it.

I have the Bali Satin Tracings bra, and aside from the seam across the bust (which can make wearing certain shirts impossible), I've been really pleased with it. However, in addition to that same seam issue, this bra has at least two major drawbacks for me. First, and most importantly, it's super pointy. It's definitely the case that it gives you a conical shape. On the one hand I can understand a slight conical shape, as minimizers are supposed to hold the bulk of your breast close to the chest -- hence the cone shape. Yet, this bra made me so pointy that it defeated this purpose, as the ""points"" extend really far forward! Second, for me, this bra doesn't do much in terms of separation. It feels a bit like a sports bra, in the sense that it feels like my boobs are being smushed together in the front. I think this is partly due to the strap placement. The pictures above don't really show this, but the straps are more toward the center of the breast, rather than toward the outer edge as most bra straps are. The effect is a slight pull toward the center, which creates the sports-bra-like, uniboob sensation. Not fun.

73,1519588135,1.0,AQFF452SVDF48,"This is a poorly written and extremely predictable book with characters that I couldn't stand.  Lena Razzi was dumped by her boyfriend on the evening that she intended to tell him that she was pregnant.  So, for three years she has had to go it alone and provide for her 2 1/2 year old son by herself.  She gets a sudden call from a temporary agency to replace ""Mr. Henderson's"" personal assistant.  She submits her resume, has an over the phone interview and is hired to start immediately.  (Yeah, like big shot company owners would let this happen.  Hah!)  The first morning she walks into the office and...TA-DAH...there is her former lover and father of her child.  He is NOT happy to see her and demands that she leave.  She talks him into giving her a trial run.  One week later she goes into his office and they strip off their clothes and have hot sex.  Hmm.  See how this is going?  It doesn't get any better...or any more believable or any more interesting, either.

Most of this book is made up of characters talking to themselves.  I don't mind a little of that but page after page after page is mind-numbing.  I started counting pages (yeah, you can see how interested I was in this story!) and there would be 4 or 5 pages of this before you would get any dialogue.  The hero(?) was a total a**hole.  He treated his family like crap, all the while complaining about what a heartless bas***d his father was.  The heroine was supposed to be a self-sufficient woman who was only interested in taking care of her son, but turned into mush every time this jerk touched her.  I disliked her as much as I did him.  I'm quite sure that their HEA is only temporary.

The reason I wanted to purchase another Skagen watch when my band broke on my other watch, is that I liked the look.  My previous Skagen watch works fine, except for the broken band.

In short, this watch is not what I had hoped for.  There is nothing unique or interesting about it.  The key feature, for me, that commends the Skagen brand is its thin, sleek casing.  Clearly that is no longer the case, at least not with this particular model.  Not sure if they no longer manufacture that line anymore.  But absent the sleek look, I will select another brand and one that I know I can service without hassle.

When your breasts are well supported and lifted it actually makes your waist look smaller! I took off one star because the quality and the fabric seems a bit cheap. I don't anticipate this bra will last a long time, but that is ok for the price and the job it does. I don't wear the same bra everyday I trade off so that helps my bras to last longer.

I'm kind of surprised nobody else has mentioned the perfumy smell in the reviews, so maybe this was a new thing or one-off.

I wonder how much money the manufacturer saves by not using the print for half the dress? If it was going to be solid, it would have been better for it to be a dark color. The dress did start to run in more than one place at the bottom where the dress is cut in a jagged cut (it is not hemmed) and this was after just wearing it once.

Perhaps the toe section is leather, but the rest appears to be synthetic and that means that the finish and materials will deteriorate very rapidly, just like all the other ""formerly American shoes"" that are being made overseas now.

When I received the product, it was WRONG. It was the canvas option.

The seller offered a refund once the product was returned (with free shipping), but their policy states that it may take up to 7 days for a refund. Unfortunately, they didn't offer an exchange option to actually get what was described on this product page. I would have to order it again - with no assurance that it would be right the next time.

This meant that I would have to spend time shipping them back, wait (up to 7 days for a refund), try to order them again in hopes that the order won't be wrong again, then wait to get them shipped back to me again. Too much hassle.

Since I was originally looking for 'canvas' chucks, and the price for these (even though canvas) was still reasonable - I decided to avoid the trouble of getting them to fix this mistake and settle with this product.

I'm more upset that the description is wrong. Buyer beware.

Having bought 1/2 dozen in a sale 7 or 8 years ago I hadn't had a need to replace them until now.  I wear the same size as I did when last purchased, however I had a very hard time getting the hook and eyes to meet on this new one.  Could be that the ""fabric"" was just too new, because once it met the other side it was okay, but without any ""play"".  The straps no longer have the small elastic portion that connects to the back of the bra so adjusting the cup means you must tighten the strap rather than ""jiggle"" it for a comfortable fit.  Unfortunately once you tighten the strap you raise the cup and it throws the cleavage into a ""mound"", not pretty!  I won't send it back as I'll use it as a ""spare"", but I won't order another one.

The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards (which includes the drivers license, library card, 2 medical cards, AARP and towing cards-no charge cards) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added.

14849,B00006XXGO,2.0,A2OK1ELE1QBVKB,"These are obviously classics. But there are two problems. The first one is the fit. After long periods of wear they start to rub against the side of the front part of my foot. This is probably due to how narrow they are. What I wonder is why my classic black and white converse chucks do not cause this issue. The second problem is that they make a sound when you are walking. Sounding something like ""thwap thwap"" which is from cloth smacking against the rubber portion of the shoe. I don't wear these often due to these two problems.",Two problems.,Negative
